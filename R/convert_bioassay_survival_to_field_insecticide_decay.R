#'@title Comvert bioassay survival to field survival when there is insecticide decay
#'
#' @param bioassay.survival = The bioassay survival at a specified resistance 
#' @param conversion.factor = A linear model coefficient obtained from performing a linear model on paired experimental hut trials and WHO cylinder bioassays.
#' @param intercept = The linear model intercept obtained from performing a linear model on paired experimental hut trials and WHO cylinder bioassays.
#'@param current.insecticide.efficacy = The insecticide efficacy of insecticide i at time since deployment Ï„ defined as proportion of fully susceptible mosquitoes surviving contact with the insecticide-treated surface.
