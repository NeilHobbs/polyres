#'@title The impact of insecticides on the relative population size of female mosquitoes the intervention site, who are now ready to lay eggs.
#'
#'@param minimum.female.insecticide.exposure = the minimim proportion of female mosquitoes exposed to the insecticide
#'@param maximum.female.insecticide.exposure = the maximum proportion of female mosquitoes exposed to the insecticide
#'@param nsim = number of interations of runif
#'@param intercept = The linear model intercept obtained from performing a linear model on paired experimental hut trials and WHO cylinder bioassays.
#'@param conversion.factor = A linear model coefficient obtained from performing a linear model on paired experimental hut trials and WHO cylinder bioassays.
#'@param current.insecticide.efficacy = The insecticide efficacy of insecticide i at time since deployment Ï„ defined as proportion of fully susceptible mosquitoes surviving contact with the insecticide-treated surface.
#'@param currently.deployed.insecticide = The currently deployed insecticide in the intervention(treatment) site
#'@param sim.array = the array that holds the simulation data
#'@param current.generation = the current generation the model is tracking
#'@param half.population.bioassay.survival.resistance = The Polygenic Resistance Score which gives a 50% survival probability in a WHO cylinder bioassay.
