#' @title Choose a subset of the total mixtures
#' 
#' @description This function selects a subset of the total mixtures that have been created. This is advantageous as
#' allowing for all insecticides to be mixed (paired) with all other insecticides is likely to be an unrealistic scenario.
#' However by randomly sampling a master dataframe of mixtures, an element of realism is implemented, as there will be random 
#' samples which result in clusters of similar mixtures (which would be expectedd from similarities in residual decay rates and 
#' ease of making mixtures out of particular insecticides).
#' 
#' @param number.of.mixtures = The total number of mixtures that are allowed to be made for use in the simulations.
#' @param potential.mixtures = A master dataframe of mixtures that are to be sampled from.
