#' @title Incorporate cross selection that occurs from changes to other traits as a result of an insecticide being deployed
#' 
#' @description When insecticide i is deployed there is selection on traits J,K,L etc; which leads to a change in trait I
#' as a result of the genetic correlation between trait J, K, L etc. and trait I.
#' 
#' @param currently.deployed.insecticide = The insecticide that is currently being deployed deployed.insecticide[generation]
